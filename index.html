          Like every other Portfolio websites out there, this too was 
          built on the objective of finding me professional exposure
          and thereby personal profits. However, these many hours into the build,
          like any other creation of mine, I would like to inculcate
          a small portion of myself in this.<br> Yes, I do know this part seems to be a
          misfit in such a professional record, this shall act as a horcrux,
          a part of myself, which I can look back on. This venture may
          seem simple, but the lessons I learnt are something I would
          like to look back on in my journey in this field.
